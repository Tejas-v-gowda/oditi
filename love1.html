    Hey babyyy ❤️  
    Finally baby… you accepted my proposal 😘  
    I love you sooo much 💋❤️
    <br><br>
    . I know you love me, but the way you show your love to me is not enough.   
       My expectations from you are like if you see just a drop of tear on my face,
       you should start crying like someone has died.
       If some girl is staring at me, you should go and tell her,
       “Don’t you dare look at my boy, he is only mine. And even if you see him, he will not respond to you.”
       And if she talks more, you should hit her.❤️
    <br><br>
    Whatever baby…

    I love you more than anything in the world. I just love you, 
    but the way you treat me and the way you treat your friends,
     in fact male friends, make me cry a lot and make me angry with you.
    Baby, I will forget everything and give you chances,
   but I really cannot forget what you did to me. I mean that Radhey matter,
   you said you blocked him, but you did not, and you were texting with him the whole time
  . And I said that that bitch Vibhuvan was staring at your chest on the trip, 
  but still you were close with him. I do not know whether you were close
   with them to make me jealous or whether that is your character🥺 
    <br><br>
     And if you break up with me ever, you know what I am going to do.
     And this Indraj matter, I have asked you so many times, 
    “Baby, is there any matter that you have hidden from me because you are scared that if I get to know it
   , I will break up?” I asked this many times, but you never said anything about him.
    And you said that only because you saw that Indraj said that you both were dating,
   that is why you said it, or else you would never ever have said this to me.
   And I do not know, baby, how you can even do these things to me when I treat you like my own baby.😌
   <br><br>
    However baby,
    what has happened has happened. Will you promise
    me that you will treat me like I treat you and like how I want
    to be treated? And will you promise me that you will never break 
    my trust and be loyal to me? You really do not know how much I love you, baby.
    and baby if i get to know that you have hidden something from na..... see..what i will doo
    <br><br>
    Okay baby, if I have hurt you, please forgive me.
     Let us be very good from this moment itself
    <br><br>
    I LOVE YOU SO DAMN MUCH BABYYYY 💖💖💖  
    <br><br>
    Happy Valentine’s Day, my favorite person on this earth 😘❤️
